# Booru Augmentation Project
A userscript that improves usability of basic *.booru.org hosted sites.

It's no secret that free accounts on booru.org offer very little convenience compared to well-developed boorus like Danbooru.  
  My goal is to do what is possible on client-side to compensate for the lack of functionality on the server side.
  
## List of features:

* Drop-down select tag list for the search field

Like on Danbooru, but so far only works for the first tag entered. 

* AJAX tag editor

Allows you to quickly add, edit and remove tags with just a few clicks and without page reloading. No more scrolling to the bottom of the page to open the edit form, do everything directly in the tag list to the left.

* Revamp Statistics area below the tag list 

Improve readability, add user links and image title, remove unnecessary info.

* Shift page number links, so that links to both 5 previous and 5 next pages are available

By default booru only shows 10 next links, which makes jumping several pages back impossible.

Aside from these, I plan to add some minor tweaks such as fitting the post image into screen width, fixing links to user accounts and some other.

You feedback is required, please go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Seedmanc/Booru-Augmentation-Project/issues) section and make suggestions which features I should add, and what would you like to see.
